# bottom-bracket-replacement

This is a guide detailing how to complete a bottom bracket replacement for a Peloton Bike or Bike+. 


How to know if it's time for it to be replaced. 
1. You will likely hear a clicking in the pedal area and may even feel the "click". 
2. You may feel the crank arm shift slightly.
3. Your ride will not feel as smooth as it originally did.


I will split this into two seperate guides for the Bike and Bike+ since the tools needed are slightly different. 

# Bike


## The tools needed are: 


[8mm Hex Allen Key](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005G395RU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

[Race Pliers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LBSLUG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)


Power drill or Torque Wrench


Phillips Screwdriver


Adjustable wrench


Replacement bottom bracket - You will have to contact Peloton to get this and should cost about $30. 


Removing the Crank Arms:
1. Start by turning the red brake handle clockwise until it locks.
2. Remove the outer belt cover by removing the 5 phillips head screws. 
3. Use the 8mm hex on the left crank arm going counter clockwise. 
4. With the bolt removed, insert the crank arm puller and turn it clockwise with your hand until it's as tight as you can get it. <!-- Include short gif detailing this? -->
5. Use the adjustable wrench and continue to turn clockwise. You will feel the crank arm seperating from the frame of the bike.
6. Remove the plastic cover
7. Repeat on the right crank arm.  
8. Use race pliers to remove the metal ring holding bottom bracket in place.

```NOTE: The bottom bracket is reverse threaded which means it's clockwise to loosen and counter clockwise to tighten it.```

9. Use the ISIS drive bottom bracket tool with the power drill or torque wrench <!-- Look up poundage for torque wrench as recommended by Peloton-->  and loosen the bottom bracket by turning clockwise. 
10. Bottom brakcet should unscrew from the frame.

Installation is the same steps in reverse order. 

# Bike+

[Race Pliers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LBSLUG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)


Power drill or Torque Wrench


4mm Hex Allen Key


Adjustable wrench


Replacement bottom bracket - You will have to contact Peloton to get this and should cost about $30. 

The steps are identical except you will not be able to turn the red brake knob to lock it since the Bike+ uses a different mechanism to control the resistence. You will have to leverage your body weight, holding the crank arm with one hand and putting your weight to loosen the 8mm bolt with the other hand.
